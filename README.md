A File based key-Value Data Store that support CRD (Create , Read, Delete) . 

# How it Works ? 

1. We have Created a file-based data store which can be used as a local storage for one single process on one laptop .

2. 'main.py' includes all the functionalities such as Create , Delete , Read , Modify .

3. Inorder to make use of those of functionalities , we have created a another file 'accessing.py' in which we whave imported 'main.py' as a library.

4. So please go through the 'accessing.py' for working of data-store as it includes all the commands .

5. Also , 'output.png' is attached to demonstrate its working in cmd.
